NodeBrew
========

Automation system for my home-brewery running on a Raspberry PI 2 with 7" touchscreen.

The UI runs in a browser and is served from a node.js backend, with websockets providing the comms.

Brewery is based on a BIAB style, similar to a braumeister, and controls a couple of pumps, temp sensors and electric elements for main vessel and HLT.
